My husband and I are visiting New Orleans for our tenth anniversary and for our first night really wanted a casual but good, Cajun/creole meal. Royal House absolutely did not disappoint. We arrived around 5:30 on a Saturday night and there was a line to get in. We were originally told it would be a twenty minute wait, but it was more like five minutes. We checked in on Yelp and received a free appetizer; hubby chose the fried alligator bites and I chose the crab claws. The alligator bites were good but not mind-blowing. The tarter sauce tasted homemade and was better than a typical tarter sauce. The star of the entire dinner were the crab claws. I cannot begin to describe how unbelievable the sauce was. The crab claws were small and more of a second thought to the bread and sauce! We ended up dipping everything we could in that sauce! I've never tasted anything like it in my life! It is filled with spice but is in no way spicy. For dinner hubby went with blackened shrimp & jambalaya and I chose the crawfish ravioli. The ravioli was definitely good, but I probably would have liked one of their other offerings better. Nothing was wrong with it-it tasted very fresh, and it's very possible that after my amazing appetizer nothing would ever taste good enough again! My hubby's dish was in my opinion much better than mine (so happy we almost always split all food 50/50 when in restaurants!). Shrimp were well cooked, fresh, and they definitely give you a large portion of them. They don't scrimp on the sausage either, and the chicken was white meat and shredded which we liked. The flavor was spot on, and we thoroughly enjoyed all the food we ordered. (Hubby really liked my ravioli). Portions were good for us-we were filled but not stuffed, with no leftovers. \n",

Our dinner came out literally as we took our last bite of our appetizer, and he was very quick when it came to bringing the check. I absolutely recommend this place-New Orleans has so many places we want to try but it will be very hard not to go back to the Royal House. Another interesting thing: we were seated upstairs and weddings would go by every 10-15 minutes, and everyone would leave their table to go out on the balcony to cheer on the couple. Definitely a great casual vibe. I only gave it 4 stars because it was our first dinner here; I may change it to five after we sample more of what NOLA has to offer!\n",

            "I see mixed reviews for the Royal House, but for my family and I, we were quite happy with our visit here.  We came on a weekday thinking the lines wouldn't be bad, but we did have to wait considering our large party.  No big deal since there is always something to see out in the streets of the French Quarter.  The architecture and history all around is a sight to see!  When we were finally seated, we were greeted by our very awesome waiter.  Our service from start to finish was top notch as well.  \n",

            "We checked in on Yelp, so were were able to redeem a free appetizer. I wanted to stick with some good ole Cajun food, so Fried Alligator it was!  It was seasoned and cooked to perfection.  It had a slight heat like I would expect out of this dish.  For my entree, I decided on the crawfish etouffee.  It was tasty and filling, but I have had better.  Now the table favorite which my daughter ordered was the pecan crusted mahi mahi.  It was pan seared, but with the pecan crust, it had a nice deep fried crust to it.  The lemon butter sauce topped on the fish was outstanding.  It really made the dish.  She ordered garlic mashed potatoes and hush puppies on the side which were both tasty.  My wife's redfish was delicious as well.  It was blackened just right and the taste was great.  For dessert, if there is bread pudding on the menu, I'm getting it, full or not!  What made this bread pudding stand apart from others is that there was peaches baked into it.  It was a nice touch and a pleasant change from just raisins.  The sauce on top was a frangelico sauce which is essentially a hazelnut topping.  Delicious I tell ya!\n",

My wife doesn't really drink so the bar isn't usually our go to for dining but since it was getting late, we went for it. Usually at a bar service is quicker since the bartender is right there and isn't hopping around to tables. The bartender immediately asks for our IDs but wasn't very courteous about it, he said it almost like he didn't think we were of drinking age and he expected that he would turn us away. We both are of age but we look younger so I wasn't surprised he asked just was expecting a little southern charm in the Big Easy and never really got that. On that same note, a guy and his son later sat down at the bar, the rest of their family, 4 women sat behind them, in assuming because they couldn't seat them all together. And the guy gave them the same speil about \"having a valid ID\" which the kid who was probably 13 clearly didn't... then the bartender went on to explain that you have to be over 21 to sit at the bar. I'm not from LA but I'm pretty sure that, that is not the law and I know most states have exceptions for consuming alcohol if you are with a parent/guardian anyway. Doesn't really matter I guess the restaurant can do whatever they want but the bartender later complained to other patrons about how people should have their IDs. \n",

Also my wife ordered a coke when I ordered my cocktail, again we are at the bar, I could have reached over and sprayed the damn thing into a glass myself if there was a glass close enough, but I had to ask the guy a second time to get her what she already ordered, this is after they had to outsource my drink. I pretty sure the guy said at one point, \"we are waiting on the whiskey\", which I was confused about what that meant.

I live along the gulf coast and I've had my share of shrimp and grits, so I was expecting large sized fresh shrimp but instead it seemed like frozen ones out of a bag tossed in sauce over 3 scoops of grits. And yes I could tell that they were scooped out of a larger dish; they were like 3 little mounds of grits. I don't think they were cheese grits either. Also the bowl that it came in was hotter than the actual meal, so they obviously warmed it up. Again it was edible but certainly not worth 20 dollars. \n",

            "I decided to be a weirdo and order a shit ton of sides as my main course. When I was looking at the menu on yelp it had all of these things listed under Lagniappe...stupid me I thought it was like a combination plate which I felt was perfect because I'm a glutton and usually want one of everything. So I had my heart set on that only to get there and realize that this was a list of the available side dishes. Since I had my heart set on it already I ordered the red potatoes; the slaw; the corn maque choux; the jumbalaya; and hush puppies.\n",
            "\n",
            "Everything was really good. The hush puppies were the best I've ever had. Slaw was good but different from any I've ever had. It is made with apples and I also tasted some cinnamon in there. It was good but a little sweet for my taste. This was my first time ever trying jumbalaya. It was delicious. Also my first time having maque choux. The corn was a little over cooked but I liked this dish as well. Kind of like a combination of corn and New England clam chowder cuz it definitely had a seafood flavor in there. My favorite thing was the red potatoes. Swimming in butter, garlic and Parmesan cheese. Flavor got a bit intense as I got to the bottom where all the sauce collected. Not healthy in the slightest but oh very delish.\n",
