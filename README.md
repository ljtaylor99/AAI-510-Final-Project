#Problem Statement

For businesses, online review sites such as Yelp provide valuable input on customer's experiences. Because of this, monitoring those comments are vital for ensuring a business' success.  
However, this can become more difficult if there is a high volume of reviews being posted. To address this problem we are going to utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP).
The goal of this project is to summarize common concerns from a corpus of review text. We intend to accomplish this goal through sentiment analysis and the extraction of N-grams.
The desired outcome is to provide an efficient and automated tool that entrepreneurs can use to manage and improve their businesses.
